## Overview
I chose this project to be my first project using Sass. I have enjoyed the API challenges from Frontend Mentor and thought this would be challenging enough to help introduce me to Sass. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process
This app was built with create-next-app, Typescript and Sass. after basic setup I built out the components and their functionality. I got the API request working and added some basic accessibility tab index's. Moving onto styling, I went for a mobile first approach and worked out from them, adding media queries and hover effects at the end. This is my first time using Sass so I'm sure there is plenty of room for code optimization but I think I have got my head around the basics and will continue to work with it on my next projects. 

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) 
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 


### What I learned

I learned a lot about Sass, including mixins, variables and media queries just to name a few. I learned that I have become comfortable with working with API's (Thanks Frontend Mentor). 

### Continued development

I think I could probable add more Typescript but overall I am happy with how this project has turned out.
